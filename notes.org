* Introduction

** What is AI?

*** Definitions: Human-centric vs. Idealistic

    Define success in terms of /fidelity to human performance/ or /ideal
    performance measure/.

    - Human-centered approach :: must be in part /empirical science/ -- entails
         observations + hypotheses about human behavior
    - Rationalist approach :: combination of mathematics + engineering

**** Acting Humanly

     - Kurzweil, 1990 :: "The art of creating machines that perform functions
          that *require intelligence when performed by people*"
     - Rich and Knight, 1991 :: "The study of how to make computers do things at
          which, at the moment, people are better"

***** Turing Test

      - Designed to provide satisfactory operational definition of intelligence
      - Computer passes test if human interrogator, after posing written
        questions, *cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person
        or from a computer*
      - Disregards physicality as unnecessary for intelligence

****** Requirements for passing

       - Natural language processing :: enable it to communicate successfully in
            English (and any other language, for that matter)
       - Knowledge representation :: to store what it knows/hears
       - Automated reasoning :: to use stored info to answer questions and draw
            new conclusions
       - Machine learning :: to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and
            extrapolate patterns

***** Total Turing Test

      - Includes /video signal/ so that interrogator can test subject's
        perceptual abilities, as well as opportunity to pass physical objects
        "through the hatch"

****** Added requirements

       - Computer vision :: to perceive objects
       - Robotics :: to manipulate objects and move about

**** Thinking Humanly

     - Haugeland, 1985 :: "The exciting new effort to make computers
          thing...machines with minds, in the full and literal sense."
     - Bellman, 1978 :: "[The automation of] activities that we associate with
          human thinking, activities such as decision-making, problem solving,
          learning..."


     - Attempting to say a program thinks like human \to need way to determine how
       humans think
     - Introspection :: trying to catch own thoughts as they go by
     - Psychological experiments :: observe a person in action
     - Brain imaging :: observe the brain in action

**** Thinking Rationally

     - Charniak and McDermott, 1985 :: "The study of mental faculties through the
          use of computation models"
     - Winston, 1992 :: "The study of the computations that make it possible to
          perceive, reason, and act"


     - Aristotle
     - Syllogisms
     - Logic

**** Acting Rationally

     - Poole et al., 1998 :: "Computational intelligence is the study of the
          design of *intelligent agents*"
     - Nilsson, 1998 :: "AI...is concerned with intelligent behavior in
          artifacts"


     - Agent :: something that acts
       - Computer agent :: higher expectations
         - Operate autonomously
         - Perceive environment
         - Persist over prolonged time period
         - Adapt to change
         - Create and pursue goals
       - Rational agent :: one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or,
            w/ uncertainty, best expected outcome
